							<p>Chelsea Leyland is an influencer on a mission. Afflicted with Juvenile Myoclonic

								The DJ and model is committed to raising awareness about epilepsy out of love for her
								sister-who is afflicted with an even severer form of epilepsy than Chelsea-and the
								re-defined sense of purpose her activism brings. Convicts recently got lucky enough to
								have chat with Chelsea. Over the course of the conversation, we got some seriously
								inspirational wisdom, harrowing stories and ultimately, an unusual and life-affirming
								look at the positive potential of fame.</p>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>Hey Chelsea, hope youâre doing well.
								Sorry to start off so heavy but could you tell us about your earliest experiences with
								epilepsy? </h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>Before I was diagnosed at fifteen, I had a few strange symptoms that built up over
									two or three years. My brain would get these flashes and cut out like an
									interruption. I'd be speaking, having a conversation, then suddenly the light would
									come and Iâd lose where I was in the conversation. I would wake up tired and have
									these little jerks in my hands. Iâd be having my cereal and the bowl would drop from
									my hands and smash on the floor.</p>
							</div>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>Did your doctor say anything about it?
							</h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>He said there was nothing wrong with me â not to worry about it and that it was a
									very normal symptom of being tired. I went back to the doctor three or four times
									and he finally sent me to a neurologist just as a precaution. At the time, I knew I
									was dealing with something very real and frightening. My boyfriend could really see
									me struggling. So I went to the neurologist and explained my story. Straight away he
									said, âYouâre suffering from something called JME â Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy.â
								</p>
							</div>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>That mustâve been terrible...</h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>It was a shock. I'd heard this word âepilepsyâ so much with my sister and everything.
									Then I was hearing someone tell me I had it myself. I felt this anger at the doctor
									who had told me for so long there was nothing wrong with me, who kind of made me
									feel like a hypochondriac.</p>
							</div>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>Your sister has epilepsy as well?
							</h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>She has a very different type than I have â hers is very severe and she can have up
									to fifteen seizures a day. Previously I told people she had it, but didnât mention
									that I had it too. I'm able to lead a normal life and she's not. Iâve always had
									that feeling that I wanted to do something about epilepsy because I felt I owed that
									to her as well.</p>
							</div>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>Did you start medicating your
								condition once you found out? </h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>It was six months after that when I had my first full-blown seizure. I fell to the
									ground and lost consciousness. Then they put me on a medication and that helped. It
									took a few years to get everything settled and to get put on the right type of
									medication. Iâve had eight serious seizures in my life at this point.</p>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>What are some of your most problematic
								triggers? </h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>Itâs often the little things. Say I've flown in from somewhere and haven't managed to
									get the sleep that I need. And I need to go to an event where Iâm having the picture
									taken and the lights from the flash â that's a big cocktail of disaster for me
									because I'm photosensitive and I shouldnât be around that frequency. Light that
									comes through the trees-dappled light-is annoyingly beautiful. Most people love it
									but I hate it because it puts me in the danger zone.</p>
							</div>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>Could you tell us a bit about this
								âdanger zoneâ youâre describing? </h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>Itâs the unsafe stage where I start feeling nervous and could potentially have a
									seizure. Now I know how to handle it, but the problem intensifies when I really need
									sleep and just canât go to sleep. The fear that Iâll have a seizure tomorrow keeps
									me awake.</p>
							</div>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>What finally impelled you to take up
								your work as an epilepsy awareness advocate? </h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>I did an interview with a magazine when I was just feeling really vulnerable. The
									interviewer asked me the usual questions about DJing and fashion, and I decided to
									just start talking about epilepsy. I wanted to raise awareness, and I told her itâs
									something Iâve been suffering from. She said, âHave you ever spoken about this
									before? If you want, we can do a full profile story and we can do a shoot with you
									and focus on that.â</p>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>And it took off from there? </h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>Every time I spoke about it, I started
								to feel good. It felt like what I was meant to be doing. Iâm entering into my truth and
								want to be true to myself. Iâve done so many interviews where the questions are âWhat's
								your must-have fashion item right now? What makeup and face cream do you use? How do you
								stay healthy?â and those questions started to get quite difficult for me. They started
								to feel quite dry and soulless and actually made me feel stupid after a while. </div>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>What makes epilepsy different from
								other diseases? </h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>Epilepsy is different than something like diabetes, itâs not detectable at first.
									When you have diabetes and you're taking your blood, or youâre asthmatic, thereâs a
									way to detect your illness. Epilepsy is something you really struggle with in the
									dark.</p>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>Has your own condition evolved over
								time? </h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>I hadn't had a seizure for seven years, then it happened again about two years ago â
									my epilepsy is affected by stress and sleep, which as you can imagine, being a DJ is
									the perfect job. I don't get any sleep, I live in New York, and Iâm always stressed.
								</p>
							</div>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>Could you tell us about the ways your
								roles as a model, DJ, and mental health advocate relate to one another? </h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>There are so many people who struggle with illnesses, especially mental illnesses
									that we donât know much about. Now people are starting to come to me and share their
									experiences with me. This process allows me to not feel guilty about all the glitz
									and glamour on the other side of my life. Itâs all about putting these things
									together and asking why I have been given this platform or this voice or this little
									piece of success. The opportunity to speak about epilepsy is quite incredible.</p>
							</div>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>Has your activism taken any new forms
								lately? </h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>We had a little girl who had four weeks to live â this was sort of a collaboration
									with Make-a-Wish Foundation â walk down the runway. Thatâs unusual for a fashion
									show and put life into perspective for everyone there.</p>
							</div>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>How does DJâing interact with your
								epilepsy? </h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>I get stressed but love to push myself to create something in the moment. There
									arenât that many females in the DJing profession but that hasnât stopped me from
									doing what I love.</p>
							</div>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>Do you have a particular strategy for
								juggling your professional life with your medical needs? </h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>Itâs important to let people know that youâre not a sob story or a flake â you have a
									legitimate medical reason for cancelling an engagement. And apparently when you get
									to thirty you really don't care what people think â I imagine when you get to forty
									you don't give a fuck.</p>
							</div>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>What else do you do to keep your
								condition between the lines? </h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>Yoga and meditation have helped quite a lot. I envision spending more time in LA and
									hopefully there Iâll get the chance to live a calmer lifestyle. Also, without a
									doubt, Alice. Sheâs my assistant. She dresses so beautifully and uniquely â amazing
									Harojuku dresses â and most importantly keeps me calm under pressure. Sheâs beyond
									being just an assistant, sheâs an admin, she handles my emails, she handles
									practically anything that relates to my life and health. She tells me not to worry
									and she sorts me out. Her sensitive, kind and spiritual soul makes me feel looked
									after. Weâre both bonkers and weâre always laughing. It makes sense that we work
									together.</p>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>Switching gears a bit, could you tell
								us about your relationship with the city? </h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>If you're a sensitive person, it can be tough. There are so many ambitious people in
									one place and everyone's trying to get ahead. It's not a place where people are
									there to be lovely and kind and get to know you. Having been at it awhile, living
									here is more about understanding yourself and what you can handle and only doing as
									much as you can handle.</p>
							</div>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>Is this home now? </h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>Iâve been in NYC for nine years and I love it. Iâm not saying goodbye to it, but Iâve
									reached a point where I know a different lifestyle could bring tremendous benefit.
									Itâs not for the naturally highly-strung, and I have this fear that I canât sustain
									my life here entirely. I may need to split my time between cities for the sake of my
									health. If anything, I need more nature â it plays such a big part in my happiness.
									I need sunshine and I want to have a cup of tea outside. I want a simpler, more
									natural way of life.</p>
							</div>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>That sounds like the right way. Thanks
								so much for talking to us, Chelsea, and best of luck with everything. </h3>
