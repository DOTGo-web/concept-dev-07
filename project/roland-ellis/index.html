								<p>Originally Port Macquarie, four hours north of Sydney, but I went to school in
									Sydney.</p>
							</div>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>How did you make your way to New York?
							</h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>I came here to do a PhD, to make music and to pursue other thingsï¹£writing and
									journalism.</p>
							</div>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>When did you make that decision?</h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>Iâve always wanted to live here. Itâs a cliche, but who doesnât? Iâve always been
									drawn to it because itâs where a lot of my favorite people have spent a substantial
									amount of time. Whenever I visited, I was drawn to the place. I donât think thatâs
									unique in any way.</p>
							</div>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>What makes New York unique?</h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>It has an energy about it. To me it feels as though if youâre not doing something
									interesting that youâre driven to do and committed to doing, youâre going to fall
									off the train and have to go home. Itâs such a competitive place with a perpetual
									motion about it, so if youâre not pushing all the time and hustling trying to get
									shit done, itâs just not going to work out. I like that feeling. I donât want to
									feel complacent. This is the perfect place for me. Humor is a huge thing with
									Australians, just not taking yourself that seriously, which is priceless</p>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>Do you ever feel that youâre doing too
								much?</h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>Sure, Iâm constantly reevaluating that idea. You donât want to be a jack of all
									trades and a master of none. The way Iâve set it up, the way I manage my time, itâs
									manageable for me to do three things that are all interwoven. Whether thatâs
									focusing on writing fiction, or film, or writing a PhD that I intend to turn into a
									book, or writing music. All of those things really feed into each other. Writing,
									whether itâs journalism, or trying to write fiction, even non-fiction, has really
									helped me as a songwriter.</p>
							</div>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>What was your upbringing like?</h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>My parents arenât musicians; my mum listens to ABBA. Thatâs about as deep as her
									music taste goes, or enthusiasm. My dad, on the other hand, is a huge music lover.
									When I was growing up, I never had an alarm clock in my house. I just had my dad
									playing music to wake me up. Iâd wake up at 7am to Born to Run playing at top volume
									with my dad in his underpants in front of the stereo, fist pumping. I donât think I
									really appreciated that at the time, when I was 7 or 8 years old. By the time I was
									13, 14 and listening to David Bowie or Tom Waits, I appreciated the education that
									my dad gave me. It was also that I wasnât allowed to listen to singles. Heâd play a
									record and heâd sit there over breakfast and explain to me that this was made in
									this year, and this is why itâs important. I would listen from cover to cover, on
									vinyl. I gained a real appreciation for the album, and also for music in general,
									and for the history of music, from that.</p>
							</div>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>Do you really write on a typewriter?
							</h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>As pretentious as it sounds, thereâs a real rhythm to writing on a typewriter. You
									feel this momentum gathering around what youâre writing. A lot of what Iâve read,
									and a lot of my own practice has led me to believe that writing on a computer is
									detrimental to the actual writing process. Youâre constantly encumbered with these
									pop-ups and email. With a typewriter you just have a page and what youâre actually
									writing. So thereâs not scope for being pulled away from that. Iâve found that
									thatâs really helped with my process. If Iâm constantly in this cycle of
									distraction, I donât get anything done.</p>
							</div>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>This city can be endlessly
								distracting.</h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>Iâve never missed anything by leaving my emails to 6 pm. If I donât check them for
									six hours, I donât miss anything. I leave it for a day, purely because setting those
									limits on myself is productive for me. Itâs probably not for everyone. My girlfriend
									is like this, and she gets stuff done. But I donât. I need that focus.</p>
							</div>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>How do you focus?</h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>I only use my typewriter, or a pen and paper, or guitar. Thatâs a real refuge from
									all that stuff. Thatâs all Iâve ever used.</p>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>How has it been to transition between

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>Australiaâs a very comfortable country to live in. For me, anyway, it was. And Iâm
									not saying that I have it hard here by any means, but youâre exposed to things, like
									a kaleidoscope of environments. Itâs such a visceral place. Thatâs constantly in
									your face, just on the subway, or wherever you go. That is really inspiring for
									work. I constantly feel that this place is so on edge. People are clinging on to
									this train thatâs out of control, and at any point they could fall off and
									disintegrate. I donât feel that itâs any different for me. It does feel like this
									constant motion. Iâve never felt that in life before. Being comfortable.
									Everythingâs fine, I know I can go stay at my parentsâ house if I run out of money.
									But here, that threat of disaster seeming somewhat imminent is exciting to me.</p>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>How do you write songs?</h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>I watched a film the other day, Ex Machina, and it talks about Jackson Pollack, and
									how he tried to basically detach his mind from conscious. The linearity of conscious
									thought, Iâm going to paint this from A to B. He just tried to let his subconscious
									flow. And this is the best way I can describe songwriting, which is something I
									really hate talking about because I always liked Dyanâs approach to talking about
									songwriting, you know, you can make your own mind up about a song rather than me
									being prescriptive. My best way to describe my own approach to songwriting is that I
									try to make it as subconscious as possible. Itâs a really free-flowing thing for me.
									I never sit down and say, âIâm going to write a song now.â It either comes out or it
									doesnât. It happens very quickly.</p>

								<p>When I think of that word, I think of, obviously a prisoner. We were sent to

									having moved away from a country that has become apathetic and affluent in so many
									ways. There are obviously so many social problems still, but life was hard there and
									now itâs easy. Artists or people who want to push beyond that have to come back out
									into the world. It requires more than apathy. All of the great Australian artists
									that I can think of-this was a big lynchpin for me in wanting to leave-I look at
									Nick Cave or Clive James or Barry Humphries, and I kind of think, well, they had to
									go overseas to get what they do done.</p>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>What are your thoughts on the

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>Humor is a huge thing with Australians, just not taking yourself that seriously,
									which is priceless, as far as Iâm concerned. A penchant to laugh things off, which
									has been with the history of our country as far back as I can think, in terms of
									stories of Australians. Everyone I look up to and love never really settles in a
									specific place, thereâs a constant need to do the next thing and build the next
									thing. Thereâs never a just like, âWell, now Iâm satisfiedâ. This constant desire to
									be unlocatable and to be moving. To be developing what youâre doing. If I sit there
									and donât do something for a day or a week or whatever, I feel so shitty about that.
									Never having time for apathy, I think thatâs important.</p>
							</div>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>Do you have the ambition to write a
								bestseller?</h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>I think you want as many people as possible to appreciate what you did. Thatâs just
									human nature. Iâve made records that no oneâs bought, and thatâs fine because they
									received good critical reviews and everything. But at the same time, you kinda wish
									it had a bigger audience. Iâd be lying if I said you didnât want heaps of people to

							</div>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>Do you feel alone when youâre
								performing?</h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>Usually when Iâm with people I feel this need to be normal. When I play live, thatâs
									a completely, like, âFuck youâ kind of experience. Thatâs how it feels to me. The
									best shows Iâve watched or been at have always been Iggy Pop or Nick Cave. It has
									this visceral quality to it. I always leave gaps where anything could happen. I want
									that feeling. To me thatâs complete freedom. It could all go to shit. It could all
									completely fall apart. The place could burn down or turn into a riot.</p>
							</div>

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>Rebellion is another theme. What does
								that word mean to you?</h3>

							<div class='block--interview-answer js-animate-text'>
								<p>Anyone who works in the arts properly, an artist, be it a writer or what you guys are
									doing-I think thereâs a sense of rebellion in doing all of that. Itâs so much easier
									to get a conventional job. I think thatâs an easier path to follow. There is a real
									sense of rebellion in saying youâre going to do what you want to do. As hard as that

							<h3 class='block--interview-question js-animate-text'>Do you have a favorite view of New

								<p>I like the empty of parts of Brooklyn. The warehouses and stuff. There are so many
									different prospects here, or things that could be happening, but itâs so kept away
